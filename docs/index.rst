**PyNodeBB** is a Python wrapper over the NodeBB (v0.7.x) API. It's useful when you don't want to use the NodeBB interface but still want to use NodeBB's ACP and backend application logic.

.. note::

    Please note that PyNodeBB has only been tested on **NodeBB v0.7.x**. Other versions have not yet been tested and may not work. Use PyNodeBB with versions other than v0.7.x with caution.
